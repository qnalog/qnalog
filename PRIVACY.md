# Privacy

This document describes QnALog (see [`README.md`](README.md) and [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) for its origin in LexVoice 2.1.2). LexVoice releases 2.2.0 and later are separate, proprietary builds whose data handling is outside the scope of this document.

QnALog is an Obsidian desktop plugin for recording, transcription, and AI-assisted note organization.

## Local data

QnALog stores plugin settings locally in your vault under:

```
.obsidian/plugins/qnalog/data.json
```

This file may contain service addresses, model names, API keys, prompt templates, queue items, and user-entered context. It is intentionally excluded from the repository by `.gitignore` and should not be committed or shared. Note that API keys are stored obfuscated, not encrypted: the decoding salt ships in `main.js`, so treat the file as sensitive.

## Network access

QnALog does not include analytics, advertising, or telemetry. It may make network requests only when you use or enable features that require them:

QnALog does not operate its own cloud storage service and does not upload recordings to any QnALog server. If recording is enabled, audio files are saved only to the local Obsidian vault path chosen by the user.


- Speech-to-text requests send audio data to the transcription service configured by the user.
- AI organization requests send transcript text and prompt context to the large-language-model service configured by the user.
- Update checks request `manifest.json` and the plugin files from this repository's `main` branch (raw source and jsDelivr mirrors). The update source is a fixed constant and is not user-configurable.
- Documentation links in settings open external web pages in the system browser.

If you configure a third-party API provider, that provider's own terms and privacy policy apply to the content you send to it.

## Sensitive content

Recordings and transcripts may contain personal, confidential, or regulated information. Users are responsible for obtaining consent where required and for choosing appropriate API providers and retention practices.

If content is confidential, private, client-related, medical, legal, HR-related, or otherwise sensitive, use local speech-to-text and a local large-language model. Do not process sensitive content through cloud APIs unless you have confirmed that doing so is acceptable for your use case and compliance obligations.
